"""MCP server exposing Kreuzberg document intelligence utilities.

This module piggybacks on the official Kreuzberg MCP server implementation so
that we can manage PDF and other document formats alongside our existing tool
suite. The Kreuzberg project already provides a comprehensive set of tools,
resources, and prompts â€“ we simply re-export its FastMCP instance so the
backend can launch it like any other built-in server.
